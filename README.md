# InferNET_Demos
Demo-Projects for Infer.NET - a framework for running Bayesian inference in graphical models.

# Abstract
This repo contains sample projects for [Infer.NET](https://dotnet.github.io/infer/) - a framework for running Bayesian inference in graphical models.  

## The Client Library
Get the Infer.NET Framework via [Infer.NET](https://dotnet.github.io/infer/) or [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Tags%3A%22Infer.NET%22)

## The Experiments List

1. Experiment N°1 - Tossing two coins. Probability both are heads?
2. Experiment N°1 - Throwing two dices. Observation - both dices never get 6 points. Probability first dice gets 6 point?

### Build and Run the Experiments
 1. Starting in the folder where you clone the repository
 
 2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select `File > Open > Project/Solution`.
 
 3. Double-click the Visual Studio 2017 Solution (.sln) file.

 4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select `Build > Build Solution`.
 
 5. If needed use NuGet Packet-Manager to solve projects dependecies (see more [here](https://github.com/dotnet/infer#installing-pre-built-binaries))
 
 6. Run the selected solution project (F5 or Ctrl+F5)
